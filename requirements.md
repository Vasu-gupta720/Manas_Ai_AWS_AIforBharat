# Manas AI – Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview
Manas AI is an India-first, voice-enabled AI companion designed to support students’
mental well-being. The system provides a safe, non-judgmental, and always-available
space where students can speak freely about academic pressure, stress, loneliness,
or emotional burnout.

The platform focuses on accessibility, simplicity, and emotional safety rather than
clinical diagnosis or therapy.

## 2. Problem Statement
Students across India face increasing academic pressure, isolation, and emotional
burnout. Despite the availability of mental health resources, many students hesitate
to seek help due to stigma, fear of judgment, or discomfort with formal systems.

Most existing digital solutions are text-heavy, clinical, or difficult to engage with
during emotionally overwhelming moments.
